# AI Patient Readmission and Automation Suite

## üîç Overview

This project develops an AI-based system to predict hospital patient readmission risk within 30 days post-discharge. Leveraging real-world healthcare data and machine learning, this suite covers the full AI development lifecycle‚Äîfrom problem definition to deployment‚Äîwhile addressing ethical, operational, and technical challenges.

## üìå Part 1: Theoretical Framework

### 1. Problem Definition

**Problem**: Predict the likelihood of patients being readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge.

**Objectives**:
1. Reduce patient readmission rates.
2. Help healthcare professionals prioritize post-discharge care.
3. Optimize hospital resource allocation.

**Stakeholders**:
- Hospital administration
- Clinicians and case managers

**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**:
- AUC-ROC (Area Under Curve ‚Äì Receiver Operating Characteristic) for binary classification performance.

---

### 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing

**Data Sources**:
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Public healthcare datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, UCI ML Repository)

**Potential Bias**:
- Socioeconomic and racial underrepresentation in the training data may skew predictions.

**Preprocessing Steps**:
1. Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
2. Normalize numerical variables (e.g., lab values).
3. Encode categorical variables (e.g., diagnosis codes via one-hot encoding).

---

### 3. Model Development

**Chosen Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
> Justification: Handles high-dimensional data well and is robust against overfitting. Also interpretable via feature importance.

**Data Splitting**:
- 70% Training
- 15% Validation
- 15% Test

**Tuned Hyperparameters**:
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in the forest. Controls ensemble strength.
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of trees. Prevents overfitting.

---

### 4. Evaluation & Deployment

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **Precision**: To assess how many of the predicted readmissions were correct.
- **Recall**: To determine how many actual readmissions were detected.

**Concept Drift**:
> Occurs when the underlying data distribution changes over time.  
**Monitoring Plan**:
- Monthly drift detection using population stability index (PSI) and data distribution checks.

**Deployment Challenge**:
- **Scalability**: Integrating the model across multiple hospital branches with heterogeneous IT systems.

## üè• Part 2: Case Study ‚Äì AI in Hospital Readmission

### üß≠ Problem Scope

**Defined Problem**: Identify patients at risk of being readmitted within 30 days.  
**Objectives**:
- Provide decision support to clinicians.
- Reduce 30-day readmission rates.  
**Stakeholders**:
- Clinicians, hospital administrators, insurance providers.

---

### üìä Data Strategy

**Data Sources**:
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Demographic profiles
- Previous admission records

**Ethical Concerns**:
1. Patient Privacy: Risk of exposing PII during data handling.
2. Algorithmic Bias: Disparities across gender, age, or race affecting outcomes.

**Preprocessing Pipeline**:
1. Feature selection: Select diagnosis, previous readmissions, vitals, medications.
2. Missing value imputation (mean/mode or predictive models).
3. Feature engineering: Creating derived variables like time since last admission, comorbidity score.

### üß† Model Development

**Selected Model**: Random Forest  
> Robust to noise, supports feature importance, and relatively interpretable.

**Hypothetical Confusion Matrix**:
|             | Predicted Yes | Predicted No |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Actual Yes  | 85             | 15           |
| Actual No   | 25             | 75           |

**Precision** = 85 / (85 + 25) = **0.77**  
**Recall** = 85 / (85 + 15) = **0.85**

---

### üöÄ Deployment Plan

**Integration Steps**:
1. Containerize the model using Docker.
2. Expose API endpoints via Flask.
3. Embed model into hospital dashboards using EHR integration tools.

**Regulatory Compliance**:
- Use secure, encrypted storage (e.g., HIPAA-compliant AWS or Azure).
- Anonymize patient data during training.
- Log all predictions for auditability.

---

### üìà Optimization

**Overfitting Mitigation**:
- Use **cross-validation**.
- Apply **early stopping** during model tuning.

---

## üß† Part 3: Critical Thinking

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Bias

**Risk of Biased Training Data**:
- If data is biased toward certain demographics (e.g., elderly), predictions may fail for underrepresented groups.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Use **IBM AI Fairness 360** to measure demographic parity, equal opportunity, and reweigh training samples accordingly.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Trade-offs

**Interpretability vs. Accuracy**:
- Deep Learning models may offer better accuracy but are less interpretable‚Äîriskier in healthcare decisions.
- Prefer interpretable models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) in critical systems.

**Impact of Limited Resources**:
- Lightweight models (e.g., Logistic Regression) may be necessary.
- Cloud-based inference services can reduce local computation loads.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram

### üîÅ Reflection

**Most Challenging Part**:
- Ensuring patient privacy while working with sensitive data.

**What Would Improve the Approach**:
- Access to more real-world labeled datasets.
- Collaboration with clinical experts for feature interpretation.
